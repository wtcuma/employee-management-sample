Initially I prepared this example as hire test task.
Then I decided to open-source it.

Problems covered in this example:

  1. Simula/Smalltalk style classic MVC vs Ext-GWT MVC.
  1. Using `<super-source />` to overdue dependency of client package in server-side code. More information can be found [here](http://iskandaronsoftware.blogspot.com/2008/11/how-to-overdue-dependencies-of-client.html)
  1. Optimal paging with Hibernate
